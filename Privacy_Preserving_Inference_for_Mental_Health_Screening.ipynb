        "This demo project demonstrates a lightweight privacy-preserving AI system for detecting early mental health risk from short text messages using encrypted inference. We simulate a realistic healthcare scenario where patient-generated data must remain confidential—yet still usable for AI-powered triage. By combining sentence embeddings, classical machine learning, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), we enable secure inference on encrypted inputs without revealing sensitive text.\n",
